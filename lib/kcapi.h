 * The kernel crypto API interface operates with two types of file descriptors,

 * The OP file descriptor receives the volatile data, such as the plaintext /
 * ciphertext, the IV, or the AEAD AD size.
 *
 * The kernel crypto API AF_ALG interface supports the concept that one TFM
 * file descriptor can operate with multiple OP file descriptors. The different
 * OP file descriptors can perform completely separate cipher operations
 * using the same key which can execute in parallel. The parallel execution
 * can be performed in the same or different process threads.
 *
 * kcapi_handle_reinit() function allows the allocation of a new cipher handle
 * with a new OP file descriptor but using the same TFM file descriptor. To
 * obtain a reference to the TFM file descriptor, an @existing cipher handle
 * is used as source. kcapi_handle_reinit() can be invoked multiple times.
 * Each resulting cipher handle must be deallocated with kcapi_cipher_destroy().
 * The deallocation ensures that the TFM resource is only released if the
